# Project Brief

## The Wisdom Lab (Mental Models)

### Core Concept

A high-precision, interactive workspace designed to sharpen decision-making and boost productivity using world-class mental models. The project aims to transform abstract productivity concepts into tangible, digital workflows.

### Key Objectives

- **Operationalize Wisdom**: Turn mental models (like the Eisenhower Matrix) into functional software tools.
- **Premium User Experience**: Deliver a "WOW" factor with glassmorphism, smooth animations, and zero-friction interactions.
- **Smart Automation**: Reduce cognitive load by automating task promotion, delegation logic, and cleanup.

### Primary Features

1. **The Focus Matrix (Eisenhower Matrix)**: A 4-quadrant task management system with intelligent routing.
2. **The Models Library**: A planned collection of frameworks (Pareto, First Principles, Occam's Razor).
