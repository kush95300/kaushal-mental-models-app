# Product Context

## The Focus Matrix (Eisenhower Matrix v2.0)

The flagship feature transforming to-do lists into a strategic map.

### Core Workflows

1. **Capture**: Users add tasks to a **Draft Queue** initially.
2. **Triaging**: Tasks are dragged from Queue to one of 4 Quadrants:
   - **Do First** (Urgent & Important)
   - **Schedule** (Important, Not Urgent)
   - **Delegate** (Urgent, Not Important)
   - **Eliminate** (Not Urgent, Not Important)
3. **Execution**: Tasks are marked as Done or Eliminated.

### Intelligent Logic

- **Auto-Promotion**: Tasks due Today/Tomorrow in "Schedule" promote to "Do First".
- **Delegation Defaults**: New tasks or tasks moved out of "Delegate" default to "Self".
- **Soft Delete**: Moving to "Eliminate" archives the task.
- **Validation**: Graceful prompting for missing data (e.g., time estimates) instead of blocking errors.

## Future Plans (The Models Library)

- **Pareto Principle**: Identifying the 20% of work enabling 80% of results.
- **First Principles**: Tool for breaking down complex problems.
