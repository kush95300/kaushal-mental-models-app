## 2025-02-23 - Invisible Focusable Controls
**Learning:** Action buttons (edit/delete) are hidden with `opacity-0` and only shown on hover, making them invisible to keyboard users even when focused.
**Action:** Ensure containers with hover-reveal patterns also use `focus-within:opacity-100` to reveal controls during keyboard navigation.
